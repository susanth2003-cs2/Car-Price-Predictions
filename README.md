# Car-Price-Predictions
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A **web-based machine learning project** that predicts the resale value of cars based on various features. This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment** with a **user-friendly web interface**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Car price prediction is a **regression problem** commonly used in automotive analytics, resale valuation, and dealership pricing. The model estimates car prices based on factors such as:

- Year of manufacture  
- Brand  
- Present price  
- Kilometers driven  
- Owner count  
- Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel)  
- Seller type (Dealer/Individual)  
- Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)

The goal is to help users, dealerships, and platforms **estimate car resale value accurately**.

## 🧠 ML Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected car-related datasets containing features and selling prices.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicate entries  
- Correcting data inconsistencies

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical variables: Brand, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission  
- One-hot encoding for brands and other categorical features  
- Feature scaling (optional, depending on model)

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing distributions of features  
- Visualizing correlations  
- Identifying trends and outliers

### 5. Train-Test Split
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets  
- Ensured proper representation of all categories

### 6. Model Training
- Trained multiple regression models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using metrics:  
  - R² Score  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

### 8. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Applied to improve model performance and reduce overfitting

### 9. Best Model Selection
- Selected the model with highest accuracy and lowest error

### 10. Model Saving
- Saved the final trained model for deployment using **Pickle**

### 11. Prediction & Deployment
- Integrated model with a **Flask-based web app**  
- User-friendly UI to input car details and get predicted price
